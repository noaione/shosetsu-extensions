# N4O Shosetsu Extensions

A collection of Shosetsu extensions that I've made as an extra accompanion for the upstream Shosetsu extensions.

It was originally a fork of the upstream repo but since they moved to GitLab, I decided to detach the fork and remove the upstream extension from this repository so there is no duplicates.

You can report any problem in the Issues tab, you can also try to request an extension (Depends on how hard it is to implement).

You can also try to contact me via Discord: **@noaione** (Please send me a message immediately so it goes to my `Message Requests`)

## Common Problems

1. **Text is missing**

Might be because my text stripping decided to strip out the rest of the text because it is wrapped weirdly, please report this and wait for the fix.<br />
After that install the new version and enable `True Delete` to delete the broken chapter and refresh.

I try my best to ensure that not all text got stripped out and only intrusive one is.

## Contributing

Contribution is allowed, as long as it is not available in the upstream repository because it is useless.

Please make sure to test the extension using my fork of [extension-tester](https://github.com/noaione/shosetsu-ext-tester)

```sh
$ java -jar extension-tester.jar src/en/NewExtension.lua
```

For ID, you can just randomly generate it.
